\description{
Here's a very handy "within" range. Checks whether a number is within a range. Capable of handling 
lists so that it can apply to a whole column. Basically I got tired of running a two-part conditional
when I wanted something that was within a range: \code{if (x > 2 & x < 5)}.

c(1:5) \%wi\% c(2,3)
