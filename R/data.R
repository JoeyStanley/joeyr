#' Joey's formant measurements
#' 
#' A dataset containing 3,504 formant measurements. After reading 300 sentences,
#' I used DARLA to automatically transcribe, force-align, and extract formants
#' from the audio. Not the cleanest dataset (plus, I had a cold that day), but 
#' it is a decent enough sample of one speaker's American English vowels. 
#' 
#' The data has been unaltered from the output FAVE produced.
